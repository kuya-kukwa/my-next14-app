This repo is a Next.js (v15) project using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It uses the pages router pattern and ships turbopack in development for a fast HMR experience.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server (uses Turbopack in this template):

```bash
# Windows PowerShell
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Edit `src/pages/index.tsx` (or `pages/index.tsx` depending on route type). The page auto-updates while running the dev server.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses Next.js modern features (Turbopack for local dev) and Tailwind CSS. Fonts and image optimization are configured using Next.js platform features.
